## Code source
The implementation of the SGP4 propagator was found here: https://github.com/aholinch/sgp4
and here https://github.com/nasa/ECI/tree/master/examples/sgp4Prop/fsw/src

The code there was published under an unlicense with no conditions. The C implementation provided by that repo has been reproduced here so that this can be used as a standalone example. 
The code was slightly modified to use the wsg84 model.

As stated by the linked repo and example readme, no gaurantee as to the flight-worthiness of this code or warrantee is given or implied.
